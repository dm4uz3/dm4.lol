## the fish

![A screenshot of the original twitter post by me, with an image of a carp and a prompt saying Tweet #carp](/img/carpscreenshot.jpg)

oh how wonderful, sending all of twitter into chaos. not even the [internal teams](https://cohost.org/atax1a/post/322642-manually-cross-poste) knew what was up

There's a gizmodo article: [here](https://gizmodo.com/heres-how-the-mysterious-twitter-carp-meme-came-to-be-1845920237) and a KYM (ew gross) page  [here](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/carp-tweets)

## pissing off catholics

![a picture of a a trans flag held up in a crowd, getting weird looks from everyone :3c. photo taken by some transphobe and posted to own me I guess. I am not going to credit him](/img/F2joQUiXIAA7uLl.jpg)

teehee 

the best thing that came out of that was this news report by SIC, it was very nice of them to give me some air time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M676fjQBT-A (CC available)

## i have successfully made youtube videos for a niche that were also interesting for the masses

The full body tracking video I made in late 2021 was cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAUMBG_4Tf8. I am kinda proud of it even though there's a lot i would do differently if I were do do it now. I also made a sequel, though nowhere near as popular. I quite like it, I think it's a very well made video :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avy43toWT4U
